NB: I took the liberty of cropping pattern.jpeg a bit so it would load faster.  The original is included in the resources folder.
I also decided to keep the style.css file in the root folder, so file paths would be more consistent.  This is after the second lesson
project where I kept wondering why the background image wasn't loading before realizing that the path was different relative to the CSS.
